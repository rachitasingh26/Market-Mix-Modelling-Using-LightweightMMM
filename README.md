# Market-Mix-Modelling-Using-LightweightMMM

Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a data-driven analytical technique used by businesses to evaluate the impact of various marketing and advertising strategies on key performance metrics, such as sales, revenue, and market share. This methodology allows companies to quantify the effectiveness of their marketing efforts and make informed decisions about resource allocation and strategy optimization. Marketing Mix Modeling is a valuable tool for businesses seeking to understand the return on investment (ROI) for their marketing activities. It allows companies to allocate their marketing budgets more efficiently, improve their marketing strategies, and maximize the impact of their campaigns.


The core statistical concept underpinning this model was Bayesian Markov chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC). What sets this Bayesian model apart from existing methods for Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is its capacity to deliver enhanced optimization by factoring in non- linear components like seasonality, holidays, and geographical variations.

• LightweightMMM: Lightweight MMM (a google engineered python library), is a data-driven analytical approach used to assess the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns. Unlike more complex MMM models, which may involve extensive data and intricate modeling techniques, lightweight MMM offers a more streamlined and accessible approach. It typically focuses on a limited set of key marketing variables, such as advertising spend, promotions, and pricing, to evaluate their impact on a specific business metric.

• Bayesian MCMC: Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a sophisticated statistical technique used for complex modeling and inference in various fields, including data science, machine learning, and marketing. At its core, Bayesian MCMC is a probabilistic framework that leverages Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate and sample from probability distributions. It combines Bayesian statistics with iterative sampling techniques, allowing analysts to make inferences, generate predictions, and quantify uncertainty in a highly flexible manner. 

In marketing and advertising, Bayesian MCMC is often used in Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) to optimize budget allocation across various media channels.
In practical terms, this tool played a pivotal role in the allocation of advertising budgets for renowned brands across diverse regions within the country. The reason for such targeted budget allocation was rooted in the understanding that different regions cater to distinct audiences and target groups. Consequently, the need for optimal budget allocation becomes paramount, as it directly influences the effectiveness and efficiency of advertising campaigns.


The Bayesian MCMC model excels in this regard by accounting for inorganic factors such as seasonality and holidays, which often introduce fluctuations in consumer behavior and market dynamics. Additionally, it takes into consideration the nuances of different geographies, recognizing that consumer responses and market conditions can vary significantly from one region to another. This level of granularity ensures that the model not only maximizes the utilization of advertising budgets but also adapts to the unique characteristics of each region, ultimately leading to more effective and targeted advertising campaigns.
